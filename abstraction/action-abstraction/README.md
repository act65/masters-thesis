Want a nice basis for planning and learning.

Properties
- Independence
- Regularity
- Abstract
- Smoothness
- Simplicity
- Composability
- Expressivity/Span/Cover
- Safety
- Efficient compilation
- Modularity (parts can be compiled independently)
- Debugging (traces => credit assignment!?)

How can these emerge out of a simpler constraint?

(also how is this related to type systems!?)

__Most importantly__. If one of these properties is satisfied, what does that tell us about the accuracy and efficiency of learning and/or planning???
