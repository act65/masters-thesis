Even after factoring symmetries in action space.
LLLR = RRRL etc

We might want to share some info?
LLLR and LLLL could share the first 3?!

Want to find an optimal code for indexing them!?

a = f(w)


***

Lets just consider the action space. We could factorise it in 2 fundamental ways?!
1) A single abstraction with length $k$ options. ('a wide net')
2) A heirarchy of abstractions with length $\frac{k}{2^l}$ options. ('a deep net')

__H:__ Using a hierarchical factorisation aids transfer. Can pick from one of the layers of the abstraction. The more similar the higher up the heirarchy.
