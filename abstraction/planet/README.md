The whole point of abstraction is that it makes the problem easier to solve.
So, lets explore some

Search (MPC/MCTS/?) + abstraction.

Min one of:
- memoize
- multi-scale transitions
- disentangled
(maybe more depending on how easy code/experiments are)


***

- if latent space is disentangled. order of actions may not matter, bc the mechanisms are independent!?
