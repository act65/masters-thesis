# Exploitable models

Why do we want to do this?

## Definition

What could help the planner do its job better?
Receiving information about he structure of the model? Beging able to use the model in 'other' ways.
How can we design a system where the model adapts itself to me maximally useful to the planner?!

Thus the desiderata of the model;

$$
\begin{align*}
\p(\cdot \mid s_t, a_t) &\approx f(s_t, a_t, \tau)\\
\exists f^{-1} \\
\end{align*}
$$

- invertible
- take a time step as input
- a point of attention

## A spectrum

Maybe the distinction between model-based and model free is less clear.

Imagine we have partially accurate/cheap approximations of the true transition function.


## Reward hacking

If the model is not accurate ...
