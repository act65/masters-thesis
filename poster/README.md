# Abstract representations

- Do the two paths lead to the same place!? (approximation error)
  - Related: Are they reliable?
- Do they use the same resources (sample and computational complexity)


## Abstract

How hard is it to find this abstraction!?

## Solve for optimal policy

(What about an iterative way to evaluate the quality of an abstraction!?)
Need a baseline? The optimal policy in the ground MDP... so we cant gain anything...!?

## Map onto original

Mapping back into original space. How hard is that?

Take the policy learned in the abstract space, $\pi_A^* (a \mid s)$, and for each state in the $\pi_G^* (a\mid g)=\pi_A^* (a \mid f(g))$
