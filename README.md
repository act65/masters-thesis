# Reinforcement learning

Research proposals

_(a bunch of potential topics for exploration)_

- critics, gradient estimation, ... (efficiently and accurately estimating reward, return and their gradients)
- [model-based RL](](https://act65.github.io/masters-thesis/model-based-rl), gradient estimation
- exploitable models (models are not treated as black-boxes)
- gradient dynamics (model an environment as a dynamical system)
- search ()
- structured representations (disentangling objection and actions, graph based NNs)
- [transfer analysis](https://act65.github.io/masters-thesis/transfer-analysis) (how is knowledge transferred, what was transferred, and why did it transfer?)
