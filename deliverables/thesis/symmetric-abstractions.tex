\section{Symmetry}

Define symmetry. Motivate why we care.


\subsection{n-dimensional Cart pole}

So, how can we test a learners ability to detect symmetries and exploit them?
We propose a simple test, the n-dimensional cart pole.

Many people realise that this problem can be reduce to $n$, one dimensional cart pole problems.
But the learner needs to infer that.
