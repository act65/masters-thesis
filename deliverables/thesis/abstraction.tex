\chapter{Abstraction}\label{C:abstraction}

What is it?

Why do we care?

By throwing away details, we can compute more efficiently, less data.
We can learn more efficiently (less noise).

There are a few different types of abstraction that can be considered for RL.

State abstractions, action abstractions, temporal abstractions.
And a few different goals of these abstractions; efficient exploration, efficient optimisation, ...?
