\epigraph{
A green leaf, is too far, out of reach,
What you want, is in front, take the steps.

You move your first leg up You move your second leg left ... You move your eleventh leg up You move your twelfth leg right

Many legs burden the act,
Unless coordinated in abstract.

The abstract words in this new language,
Must be as few as we can manage.

"left", "right", "forward", "backward"

This time, the act is rather brief,
"forward", to reach the tasty leaf.
}{\textit{Mac Flecknoe \\ John Dryden}}
