\caption{Consider a hungry caterpillar. It wants to move towards the leaf. But this is a complicated task! Move your 3rd leg up, your 7th leg down, 11th lag slignly forward, etc... But, what if it could specify actions in another way? Rather than specifying leg movements, it could pick a direction to move, which would specify a program of leg movements.}

\epigraph{
A green leaf, is too far, out of reach,
What you want, is in front, take the steps.

You move your first leg up You move your second leg left ... You move your eleventh leg up You move your twelfth leg right

Many legs burden the act,
Unless coordinated in abstract.

The abstract words in this new language,
Must be as few as we can manage.

"left", "right", "forward", "backward"

This time, the act is rather brief,
"forward", to reach the tasty leaf.
}{\textit{The writer an poet; Alex Telfar}}
