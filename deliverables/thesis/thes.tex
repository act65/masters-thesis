\chapter{Timeline}

\begin{enumerate}
  \tightlist
  \item In my proposal I stated that I wanted to understand \textit{transfer} and \textit{HRL}. With the goal of understanding and / or improving an agents ability to learn.
  \item I completed four 'sprints'; \textit{HRL, exploration, IRL, disentanglement}, each of two weeks. After these sprints I decided to focus on \textit{action abstractions},
  which can be related to disentanglement.
  \item I explored more general results about abstractions. I was especially interested in theoretical ways to analyse MDPs such as near optimality \cite{Abel2017}.
  \item Something about action abstractions.
  \item I understood that HRL is a special case of abstraction; one of a special hierarchical structure, and which is focused on achieving a temporal abstraction. I also became aware that no abstraction is likely to do better or worse than any other, in the general case (once you account for the complexity of building the abstraction -- this is a result of the no-free-lunch theorem).
  \item I went to a conference and met Theja Tulabandhula. He was presenting his paper on symmetry based abstractions for RL \cite{Mahajan2017}. This is exactly what I had been looking for, but didn't know it. I promised myself I would look into it further.
  \item After reading a few papers on the theory of RL, I decided I wanted a better understanding of MDPs, which were the main setting considered in the proofs I had been attempting to understand.
  \item I found a great paper, the Value function polytope \cite{Dadashi2018}, that gave insight into the structure of the MDP and it's optimisation. I explored this further and got curious about how to understand optimisation, overparameterisation and dynamics for RL.
  \item With my new understanding of MDPs, I returned to the problem of abstraction. A simple, and easily solvable system is a linear one. Is there a way find and exploit linearity within an MDP?
