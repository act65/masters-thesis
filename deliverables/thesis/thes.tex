\title{ABSTRACTION FOR EFFICIENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING}
\author{Alexander Telfar}

\subject{Computer Science}
\abstract{
Successful reinforcement learning requires large amounts of data, compute, and some luck.
We explore the utility of abstractions to reduce this dependency on large amounts of data / compute.
Specifically, we consider a type of linear abstraction, and show that it doesn't work in general.
Then, we construct a measure of symmetry and use it to build abstractions, in the hope of improving sample efficiency.

% Books don't normally have abstracts, and this is a bit of a hack
