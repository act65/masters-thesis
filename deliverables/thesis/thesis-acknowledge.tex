Mostly, I would like to thank my advisers: Will Browne, for supporting my work and giving me the freedom to explore my interests.
And Brendan McCane for timely feedback.

I would also like to thank Daniel Braithwaite, Marcus Frean and Stephen Marsland
for their friendship, humour and intellectual support.
And, I would like to thank my family (Ian and Evee), who, for some reason, put up with me.

And finally, I am thankful that SFTI supports theoretical work, despite its high risk.
