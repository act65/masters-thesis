How can theory help tame this mess?


How does this lead to studying MDPs?


That isnt to say that theory is all good.
Examples of bad theory. Unrealistic assumptions. Symbolics for the sake of symbols.

Why? Instability, non-convex, hyper parameter searches, subtle design decisions, not analysing the variance, computational cost, 

Hyper parameter searches confound the issue. 
Need a test set. To verify.
But in DRL we train and test on the same problem. Does that really make sense?


The point is that doing science on DRL;
- requires lots of compute,
- is currently flawed
- ?

Just take a look at some recent papers...

RL has some nice theoretical results to build on! (unlike DL).
