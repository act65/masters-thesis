\section{Action abstractions}


\epigraph{
A green leaf, is too far, out of reach,
What you want, is in front, take the steps.

You move your first leg up You move your second leg left ... You move your eleventh leg up You move your twelfth leg right

Many legs burden the act,
Unless coordinated in abstract.

The abstract words in this new language,
Must be as few as we can manage.

"left", "right", "forward", "backward"

This time, the act is rather brief,
"forward", to reach the tasty leaf.

Action abstraction is possibly the least explored type of abstraction.
There exists a lot of work seeking state abstraction (refs), and heirarchical (temporal) abstraction (refs)
but, this has only recently been some work ...

\subsection{Interfaces}

The intution is.
People can generalise / adapt between different action spaces.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Might be teleported to a new environment? (new state space, same
  action space)
\item
  Might have to drive a new vehicle (same state space, new action space)
\end{itemize}


Utility?
- Adapt to broken limbs
- To new ?

% SGD + regularisation -> Langevin dynamics -> rejection sampling???

% \subsubsection{Langevin dynamics}
%
% Clip to nearest symmetric abstraction.
%
% \begin{align}
% \mathop{\text{argmin}}_{\theta} D(\bar \theta, \theta)
% \end{align}
%
% Where $\bar \theta$ is the nearest symmetric set of parameters.
%
% \begin{align}
% \theta = \theta_t - \eta \nabla_\theta \mathcal S(\theta) + w
% \end{align}
%
% Langevin dynamics. Where $w$ is sampled from some noise distribution.
% Therefore, we get a distribution over $\theta$.
% Only do a few iterations, so we sample $\theta$ that are near by!?!?
% The $\nabla_\theta \mathcal S(\theta)$ pulls us towards symmetric parameters.
%
% Need a differentiable measure of symmetry.!?
% If I actually find this, we can just use it as a regulariser..!?!?!?
