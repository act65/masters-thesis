\hypertarget{hrl}{%
\subparagraph{HRL}\label{hrl}}

Temoral abstractions of actions.(how does this related to a
decomposition of rewards) Ok, so we wany a multiscale representation?
Understanding how actions combine (this is necessary knowledge for HRL?)

Reasons to do HRL??? (want to verify these claims - and have refs for
them)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  credit assignment over long time periods (learning faster in one env)
\item
  exploration
\item
  transfer
\item
  To learn action abstractions they must capture info about the model.
  How much harder is it to learn action abstractions in model-free vs
  model-based settings?
\item
  Reward as a function of a subspace of the state space. (this is
  important for learning abstract representations and actions!?)

  What do cts linear heirarchical actions look like!? and their loss
  surface!?

Relation to pretraining / conditioning?

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Why does Heirarchy (sometimes) work so well in reinforcement learning?

The authors claim that the benefits of HRL can be explained by better
exploration. However, I would interpret their results as saying; ``for
2D environments with walls, larger steps / actions result in greater
explration''. But what if the walls were replaced by cliffs? I imagine
this algorithm would do a lot worse!?

They also seem to misunderstand the main problem with HRL, discovery.
Once you have discovered a nice set of abstracted actions / a
representation, then yeah, you get faster reward propagation, better
exploration, \ldots{} etc.

\hypertarget{dynamic-programming}{%
\paragraph{Dynamic programming}\label{dynamic-programming}}

What is it? Memoized search. Why should we care?

\hypertarget{model-based-rl}{%
\subsection{Model-based RL}\label{model-based-rl}}

Pros and cons.

Model-based learning can be bad\ldots{} There may be many irrelevant
details in the environment that do not need to be modelled. A model-free
learning naturally ignores these things.

The importance of having an accurate model!

For example, let \(S\in R^n\) and \(A\in [0, 1]^n\). Take a transition
function that describes how a state-action pair generates a distribution
over next states \(\tau: S \times A \to \mathcal D(S)\). The reward
might be invariant to many of the dimensions.
\(r: X \times A -> \mathbb R\), where \(X \subset S\).

Thus, a model mased learner can have arbitrarily more to learn, by
attempting to learn the transition function. But a model-free learner
only focuses on \ldots{}

This leads us to ask, how can we build a representation for model-based
learning that matches the invariances in the reward function. (does it
follow that the invariances in reward fn are the invariances in the
value fn. i dont think so!?)

Take \(S \in R^d\) and let \(\hat S = S \times N, N \in R^k\). Where
\(N\) the is sampled noise. How much harder is it to learn
\(f: S \to S\) versus \(\hat f: \hat S \to \hat S\)?

\hypertarget{representation-learning-and-abstraction}{%
\subsection{Representation learning and
abstraction}\label{representation-learning-and-abstraction}}

The goal is to find a representation that decomposes knowledge into its
parts.

Another way to frame this is: trying to find the basis with the right
properties.

\tightlist
\item
  sparsity,
\item
  independence,
\item
  multi scale,
