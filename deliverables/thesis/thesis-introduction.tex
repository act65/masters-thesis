  Near optimal representations
\item
  Solvable representations (LMDPs)
\item
  Invariant representations (TODO)
\end{itemize}


We explore four algorithms.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Memorizer: This learner memorizes everything it sees, and uses this
  knowledge as an expensive oracle to train a policy.
\item
  Invariant. This learner discovers symmetries in its evironment and
  uses this knowledge to design an invariant representation.
\item
  Tabular. \ldots{}
\item
  MPC. \ldots{}
\end{itemize}
