% RL is inefficient
Reinforcement learning has an efficiency problem: AlphaGo \cite{Silver2016a} (the Go
playing AI that beat world champion Lee Sedol) played 1.28 million games, with
extra supervision from another 29.4 million positions, using 50 GPUs.
OpenAI Five \cite{OpenAI2018} (the Dota 2 playing AI that beat OG, the winners of TI8/9) was
trained over 10 months, collecting 900 years of experience per day, using
128,000 CPUs and 256 GPUs.

Is RL fundemntally expensive, or can we do better?
Bounds on sample and computational complexity tell us that !??!
