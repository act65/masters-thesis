> 6. When attempting to learn a model, the agent uses an exploration policy. This policy may influence the dynamics observed, thus we need to use off-policy methods to correct for the effects of exploration actions. (The model must somehow disentangle the agents policy, and its effects, from the dynamics of the system)
