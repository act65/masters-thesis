How does HRL help temporal credit assignment?

- [Temporal credit assignment in RL - Sutton 1984](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations/AAI8410337/)
- [Hierarchical visuomotor control of humanoids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09656)

Why is it easier to learn in a more temporally abstract space?


> 1) [Temporal abstraction] speeds reward propagation throughout the task.
> 2) Even if the abstract actions are useful, they can increase the complexity of the problem by expanding the action space
> 3) Advantages are dependent of the quality of the abstract actions; ... unhelpful actions, ..., can actually make the problem more difficult for the agent.

Credit assignement is harder when there are more possible assignments of credit. (but we are not donig credit assignment!?)
