> 5.Build a differentiable neural computer (Graves et al. 2016) with locally structured memory (start with 1d and then generalise to higher dimensions). Is the ability to localise oneself necessary to efficiently solve partial information decision problems? Under which conditions does the learned index to a locally structured memory approximate the position of the agent in its environment.


Memory structures + Locality.
