> 7. Inverse energy learning. Inspired by inverse reinforcement learning [@Ng2000AlgorithmsFI], what if we assume that the observations we make are the results of some optimal action, in this case, of an energy function being minimised.

### Summary

- There is a lot of non trivial work to required to motivate energy based approaches.
- Sprint 3. is contained within this question (will need to generate another sprint).
- [Concept Learning with Energy-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02486) is very close to what I had in mind.
- The are many interesting questions to do with local energies, but it doesnt seem clear how to approach.
