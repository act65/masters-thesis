### Stretch

- Ok, it has limitations. Not able to oscillate (if we only have a single fn). What about an ensemble? How powerful is that? Or local minimisation of an energy fn shared over space/time?
- If we used this model as part of an ensemble, would it learn to model agents, independently capturing their value functions.
- Could extend to adding more structure into the energy function or update? (e.g. scale by hessian)
- computational complexity versus SGD on NN.
- implement on atari.
- problem. for most atari games, a single frame is not enough to fully specify the state, need the velocity as well.
- is it possible to get non-linear behaviour from many locally convex energy fns? (yes?)
- what if we dont get to observe optimal trajectories? only approximately optimal??? humans often dont know the best way...
- model emergent colloidial structures and attempt to learn the (local) energy function they are optimising.
- will NNs work well in this local setting? quite often they will see nothing/be in some local minima!?
- oh... how is this related to equilibrium propagation?!?
- What problems are ensembles of local losses bad at?

### Local loss

Let $s$ be a n dimensional tensor $\in R^n$. Then the global energy can be written as the sum over many dimensions (such as space or time) of the local energies.

All possible states can be described by $s\in S \subset R^n$. The env is described by a set of all possible states, $S$. The current state is an element of that set. For example, a tensor of real values (representing, say, a map).

$$
\begin{align}
E(s) &= \sum_{i \dots k} E(s_{i \dots k}) \\
\end{align}
$$


__But.__
- How do we construct $s$ in the first place to have locally structured dimensions?
- How do we know which dimensions to share the loss over?

What if $x$ was a graph instead? A dimension would be an ordering of the nodes (ordered by reachability or proximity in time).
How do you learn that the x and y dimensions???

- In boids the dimension we are using is for each 'bird'.
- In colloids the dimension we are using is each 'colloid'.
- In classical physics the dimension we are using is time (???). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_principle_of_least_constraint
- Spin glasses? Phase transitions? Tensor networks and renormalisation?

Clustering the nodes in the graph by similarity (within subset of their embeddings) could find these dimensions!? (at least the boids/colloids?)

But how to find structure!? Which dims to share the loss over?

##### Time series.

Unsupervised learning for time series. How can this be done? It is often done by modelling the time series as being generated by a step function $s_{t+1} = f(s_t)$


### Connections to other sprints

- locally structured representations for local energies
- energy ~= density?!
