Statistical view of disentanglement -> Kernel tests, ...?
Optimisation view of disentanglement -> ?


So clustering achieves what ICA attempts to?
If we consider the cluster labels as an indpendent basis!?


Independence isnt really what we are about? What to recover the 'atoms' used to construct the observations.


Wait a minute. Independence means... info about A tells me nothing about B. But if I know that A generated X, then I can explain away B's influence!?

## Information bottleneck

> However, no algorithm is known to minimize the IB Lagrangian for nonGaussian,
high-dimensional continuous random variables

hmph. someone should solve that...

When minimising $I(x, z)$, $z$ could be invariant to $x\sim p(x)$, but still be sensitive to other distributions?!?
