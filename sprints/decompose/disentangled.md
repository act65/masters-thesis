Examples of disentanglement

## Definition



## Moving mnist

With 2 digits just bouncing around they are definitely independent. But what if they are allowed to bound off each other? Their appearance is independent but thei position is not.

What about having to seek out the digits on a changing scene? What about having to do arithmetic with them as well?

- want to learn some heuristics. what moves together is not independent. local relationships imply ...?

## Representation

What if I have an independent variable that is a ring, or has some other topology other than a line?
