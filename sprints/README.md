I have allocated time for 8 'sprints', each of 2 weeks. The goal of each sprint will be to;

- motivate the idea as a solution to an existing problem,
- prove that the "existing" problem really exists,
- generate alternative solutions and a suitable baseline,
- design the minimal viable experiment to falisify the proposed solution,

### The sprints

- Disentanglement.
- Temporal meta-RL and lr2rl.
- ?
- Differentiable decompositions.
- Locally structured memory
- Effects of exploration policy.
- Inverse energy learning.
- Reachability.
