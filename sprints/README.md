I have allocated time for 8 'sprints', each of 2 weeks. The goal of each sprint will be to;

- motivate the idea as a solution to an existing problem,
- prove that the "existing" problem really exists,
- generate alternative solutions and a suitable baseline,
- design the minimal viable experiment to falisify the proposed solution,

### The sprints

- Differentiable decompositions: metrics for disentanglement.
- Differentiable decompositions: modular credit assignment.
- Causal RL. OR Temporal credit assignment. OR MBRL...
- Memory (locally structured)
- Exploration (effects).
- Reachability.
- Inverse energy learning.
- Heirarchical RL.
