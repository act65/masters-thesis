> 1. Can we formalise what we mean by “decompose”? Can we differentiate it (so we can use it within the deep learning framework)? What is its relationship to independence criterion and independent component analysis?

TODOs

- Implememt latent independence
- Disentangle moving mnist
- Derive gradients, dynamics and fixed points of $min TC(Wx)$
- Unify structural and soft priors for independence
- I would expect decomposition/disentanglement to be much easier in the RL setting as we get to take actions, to test independence!?
