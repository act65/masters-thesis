The space we are searching makes a large difference to the efficiency of optimisation algorithms.

Smaller search spaces are better.
But adding structure (for example, locally linear) are even better.


$$
K, n \ge 2 \\
(k-1) ^ n \ge k^{n-1} \\
k^n - k^{n-1} = ??? \\
k^n - (k-1) ^ n = k \\
$$


Why is it at when solving MDPs, we do not need to optimise in the space of possible policies, but rather the space of value functions.
Why is it that

When transforming between two spaces, how does the optimisation space change?
Does my abstraction make optimisation easier?


How does knowledge about the value of one policy / action help you figure out the value ofother policies / actions?
