# Representation learning

Representation learning is the key idea hiding behind current advances in machine learning.
From deep learning []() to evolutionary computation []() to ... we see representation learning being used. It goes by many names, abstraction, unsupervised pretraining, ...

We want to learn a representation of the problem that makes the problem easier to solve.


### What do we mean by a representation?

Some how it captures the essence of the problem. No noise, no extraneous details, no ...?.


### Why do we care?

(learning to) Build a representation that makes the problem (/data) easier to solve.
(maybe easier by allowing reduction to an existing problem, with known algol)



What are the best examples of representation learning providing a benefit?

- PCA
- Non-convex opt with sin / square
- From optimisation literature?
- Deep neural net. Learn a new representation for linear regression...
-

### Open problems

Want to exploit regularities/symmetries in the problem to build an abstract representation of the problem that makes solutions easier to find.
