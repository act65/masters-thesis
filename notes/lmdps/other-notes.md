  How does p(s'\textbar{}s) bias the controls found??? I can imagine the
  unconstrained dynamics acting as a prior and prefering some controls
  over others.
\item
  If we have m states and n actions. Where m
  \textgreater{}\textgreater{} n. Then \(u(s'|s)\) is much larger than
  \(\pi(a|s)\). Also, \(u(s'|s)\) should be low rank?!
  \(u_{s's} = \sum_a u_a \alpha_a u_a^T\)
