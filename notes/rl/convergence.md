Is it possible to do an spectral analysis of these operators?
Operators = $GD, T^{* }$.

## Alternative derivation of V = (I-gamma P.pi)^{-1}r.pi

For any exponentially contractive operator, acting on a field.

> Geometric series

$$
r \in (-1,1) \\
\frac{1}{1-r} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=0}^{n} r^i \\
$$

So this is an example of a contractive operator, $f(n) = x^{n}, x\in(-1,1)$.
But what if our operator is ...?

$f(n) = A^{n}, \det(A)\in(-1,1)$

Bellman operator.



Neumann series

$$
\begin{align}
(I -T)^{-1} &= \sum^{\infty}_{t=0} T^k \\
T &= r_{\pi} + \gamma P_{\pi} \\
???
\end{align}
$$

If the Neumann series converges in the operator norm (or in any norm?), then I â€“ T is invertible and its inverse is the series.
If operator norm of T is < 1. Then will converge to $(I-T)^{-1}$?


- what about operators that contract at different rates?
- ?
