Exploration and exploitation and experimentation.


***
Want to generate 'natural' trajectories, free from any dependence on our actions. (why, this way we get to observe the rules of nature).

Imagine a simple experiment. Set it up and then explicitly take no further actions (only observe). This is not guaranteed to work. For example, ??? (experiment is influence by the presence of the experimenter.)
How can you avoid this?

Physics experiemnts achieve this by (buried under millions of miles of rock, in a vaccuum chamber, ...). But there have been plenty of experiments that ...?

How can you know that you haven't had any unintended effect on the observations?
