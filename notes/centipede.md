Imagine you are a centipede.

You have a hundred legs... And you are hungry.
To reach the food your can faintly smell, you need to navigate a maze.

But getting there is complicated...! You can move leg 27 up a little, leg 78 forwards, legs 45-52 downward, ... Etc.
What you would really like if a set of higher level commands, that can be decoded into these leg movements. Commands like; move forward a few inches. Go faster. Turn left... Etc.

What about even higher levels of abstraction? You could learn to combine; left-left-shake booty-right-right into some cool dance moves and name it the...

Is there a general way to discover or learn these abstract actions? If you have access to these higher level commands, how much easier does it make your life? Can you solve/achieve things you couldn't beforehand? ...
