What is the geometry of this?
- Have the Q values being pulled towards their true values by the tradtional TD error, or similar.
- Have 'similar' state-actions being pulled together.
  - In the case the $\chi$ is based on Q values. This would mean a kind of density based attractive force!?
  - Higher density positions are more attractive.

We think we have found a mirror symmetry. We use this to reduce the search space, and only explore one side. But we were wrong about the mirror symmetry, and there is a sparse, large, reward in one of the sides. Did we do worse than before?


Questions
- where does compression come into disentanglement?!
- Completeness of the abstraction. it can caputre any / all symmetries? which symmetries are harder to learn?

TODOs
- Test clustering with unparameterised $\chi$
- Test clustering and generalisation with parameterised $\chi$
- Test ?!?
