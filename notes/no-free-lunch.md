Simply split the learning complexity between discovering a higher level language.

> The challenge in the single-task case is overcoming the additional cost of discovering the options; this results in a narrow opportu- nity for performance improvements, but a well-defined objective. In the skill transfer case, the key challenge is predicting the usefulness of a particular option to future tasks, given limited data.
