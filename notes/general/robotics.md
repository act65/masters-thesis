How does RL relate to robotics?

What are the open theoretical questions?

- Guarantees on behaviour!!
- Ability to transfer. Despite a large amount of interest. Robust learned policies require large amounts of training data. A prioir knowledge of the domains.
- Ability to scale. Large state spaces, complex..
