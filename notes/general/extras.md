Want a general way (a function) to take an abstraction of an MDP
(defined by certain propreties) and return the difference between its
optimal policy and the true optimal policy. Want automated computational
complexity to solve this! Actually, we are not considering computational
complexity here only approximation error. For that can we just use
automatic differentiation!? Want a way to get bounds for all of these
combinations!

Requires the evaluation of expensive integrals?!?
