Dynamic programming is a meta strategy for solving complex problems. We reduce the complexity into simpler parts, solve them, then combine the solutions to solve the origial, complex problem.


This is just a dynamic programming problem.
Search plus memoization.


MB-DRL
- The search can be done using MCMC.
- The memoization can be done with a neural network, the policy.

MCTS
- The search can be done using MCMC.
- The memoization can be done with a tree.

CFR
- ?
- Tree


Ultimately we want an incremental way build the optimal policy.

The search needs to be;
- ?


The memory needs to be;
- easily indexed by context (observations)
- ?
