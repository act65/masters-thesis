Representation learning (...)
(learning to) Build a representation that makes the problem (/data) easier to solve.
(maybe easier by allowing reduction to an existing problem, with known algol)
Want to exploit regularities/symmetries in the problem to build an abstract representation of the problem that makes solutions easier to find.

Symmetry + disentanglement + variational calculus + symplectic geometry + optimisation + generalisation +
