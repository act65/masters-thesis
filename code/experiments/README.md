- `polytope_entropy.py`: How are policies distributed in value space?
  - Are many policies close to (or far away from) the optimal policy?
  - How does abstraction effect the distribution?
- `gpi_partitions.py`: How does generalised policy iteration partition the policy space?
  - Why do infinitesimally similar policies need more or less GPI steps?
  - How does GPI scale into higher dimensons (of states and / or actions)?
