A way to generate toy HRL puzzles/envs. Want a set of priors! What properties do they have?!


What properties of an env can be exploited by HRL to reduce learning complexity?

Let's generate some envionments that have;

- heirarchical actions spaces (what does this imply about the structure of the state space!? and the model?)
- reward being a fn of ??? (a subspace of state space?)
- ?


Pieter Abbeel mentioned an env they designed.
> Grid world where agent must discover the passcodes for the actions (left right up down). For example left might be 0,0,1.
