### Near optimal abstractions
The different types of similarity metric you might want to use to build an abstraction (and their power).
The types of abstraction you might want to use (and their power).
Bounds on accuracy for action abstractions
Stretch
- experiments / bounds for all combinations

### Action abstractions
Meta learning
- Generalising to new 'interfaces'
- Scaling to large action spaces

Stretch
Nice properties of action spaces
- independence
- regularity
Temporal abstraction

### Linear representations + GPI
Build / train / test abstracted linear learner
Use polytopes of do analysis of learning dynamics of GPI

Stretch
- Explore bounds of approximation error
- Computational complexity of GPI

### Disentangled abstractions and symmetry
(still working out details)

Build an abstraction using a metric for disentanglement.
Build an abstraction using an approximate symmetry measure.
How are these two things related!?!?

Stretch
Sample efficiency and sharing
