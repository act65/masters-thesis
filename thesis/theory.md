Current theory does not take into account the structure within a RL problem.

The bounds are typically for the worst case.
But these bounds could be tighter if we exploited the structure tht exists in natural problems.
The topology of the transition function; its, sparsity, low rankness, locality,
The symmetries of the reward function.
??? (what about both?!)
